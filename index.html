		<p>Our internship program began on May 5, 2023 when we attended
			DLaunch(<b>Global Internship Program Orientation</b>). Some of us travelled 
                        to new cities and were able to explore and meet some amazing fellow interns 
                        and Deloitte professionals. We are all working in different service areas within Deloitte Global
			Technology, but without a doubt we are learning and growing a lot,
			both personaly and professionally. Out first week was packed with
			events and orientation programs, such as learning more about different 
			service areas and impact Day. Impact day allowed us to
			help out our community through activities like <b>gardening, painting,
			recording audiobooks, and more </b>. We were also given the opportunity to
			travel to Dallas, Texas where we participated in an <b>innovation challenge
			Workshop</b> and visits Deloitte University for intern conference. This
			amazing experience allowed us to make a lot of important connections
			and undergo professional training. With our internship ending on
			August 11, we are sad to see it go but glad that we've had the
			experience and excited to see what the next few weeks hold!</p>
